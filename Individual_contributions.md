#                           INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS

## Vishwa Tejendra Pernapati
•	Data Preprocessing – Filled the Na values with mean/ mode for specific columns.
•	Scaling – Applied Min Max Scaling and Standard Scaling that is necessary for specific models before classification analysis.
•	Random Forest Classification - Analyzed the data and used Random Forest Classifier for prediction analysis.
•	Decision Tree classification - Analyzed the data and used Decision Tree Classifier for prediction analysis.
•	Men_Ice_Hockey - Worked on calculating prediction accuracy for specific sport (Ice_Hockey)
•	Report Preparation – Contributed to report preparation.

## Pranav Chellagurki
•	Data Preprocessing – Converted categorical variables to numerical values.
•	Encoding – Encoded the data using One Hot Encoding and Label Encoding that is necessary for feature selection process.
•	Logistic Regression – Analyzed the data and used Logistic Regression model for classification.
•	XG Boost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) - Analyzed the data and used Extreme Gradient Boosting model for classification and prediction analysis.
•	Men_Football - Worked on calculating prediction accuracy for specific sport (Men_Football)
•	Report Preparation - Contributed to report preparation.

## Shail Brijeshkumar Patel
•	Data Visualization – Created Bar graphs and pie charts for visual analysis.
•	KNN Model Analysis - Analyzed the data and used Logistic Regression model for classification which ultimately provided the best metrics.
•	Men_Water_Polo - Worked on calculating prediction accuracy for specific sport (Men Water Polo)
•	Report Preparation - Contributed to report preparation.

## Rakesh Reddy Sanagala
•	Data Visualization – Created Histograms, bar graphs and seaborn plots for better analysis.
•	Men_Hockey – Worked on calculating prediction accuracy for specific sport (Men_Hockey)
•	Feature Selection – Selected necessary features (columns) from all the given columns using Random Forest analysis. Also tested Backward Elimination and Forward Selection processes for feature selection.
•	Report Preparation - Contributed to report preparation.
